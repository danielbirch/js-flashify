## Development Checklist 💻

- [ ] Convert the app from Options API to Composition API
- [ ] Install and setup Pinia state management
- [ ] Check the app to ensure the use of components and that the app is built in a modular way
- [ ] Move all Firebase code into `/src/firebase/` and use `firebase.js` for initializing, `db.js` for Firestore helper functions and `auth.js` for Firebase Authorisation helper functions
